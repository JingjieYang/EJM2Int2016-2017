# Biology - Cell division
### Cell cycle
Cells go through life cycles of growth & division

### Main phases:
- **G1:** Cell grows
- **S:** Synthesizes DNA
- **G2:** Cell grows more to be large enough to split in half
- **Mithosis:** Nucleus divides

### Mitosis:
- **Prophase:** chromosoms condense, nucleus dissolves.
- **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align in the middle
- **Anapahse:** Chromosomes duplicate, halves get pulled to poles of the cell.
- **Telophase:** Nucleus starts to reform around the chromosomes
> See the poster diagram.

### Cytokenisis:
> **It's after mitosis.**  
> **Splitting of cytoplasm.**  
> **Form 2 identical daughter cells.**
