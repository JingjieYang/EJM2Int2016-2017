Vein: into the heart  
**A**rtery : **A**way from the heart


`diagram here`
blue: Oxygenated blood
Red: Deoxygenated blood

- Systole: muscle contracted, high pressure in the heart. (Push the blood away)
- Diastole: muscle relaxed, low pressure in the heat. (The blood flows in the heart)

`Sound: LUB DUB`

### Systole:
- Atria muscles contract, forcing blood ingto ventricles
- Ventricle muscles contract
- Atrio-ventircular valves shut and hold the blood in the ventricles
- Semi-lunar valves open
- Blood flows away from the heart

### Diastole:
- Semi-lunar valves shut. Catching the blackflow (DUB)
- Blood drains into ventricles
- Atria and ventricle walls relax, pressure drops in the ventricles.
- Atria fill with blood returning from the veins
