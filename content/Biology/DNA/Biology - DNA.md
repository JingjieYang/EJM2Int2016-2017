# Biology - DNA
Each of us has a different, specific DNA, which gives us a unique genetic code. Our DNA determines the way we look, how each cell in our body works, and even can shape aspects of our behavior.

### How does DNA determine us?
- Every part of our body is different, made up of different cells, yet they all have the same DNA. 
- Each type of cell is different because of the different proteins which it has, which is determined by our DNA code. Our cells can all be different, even though all have the same DNA, because in each cell some parts of the DNA are 'turned on', while other parts are 'turned off'.

### DNA structure
- Its shape is a double stranded helix.
- It is made up of 4 different bases.
	- adenine (A); thymine (T)
	- guanine (G); cytosine (C)
- On one strand there is a code of A, C, G, & T, and the opposingstrand will be matched up:

> A bonds with T ; C bonds with G

- When the cell is going about normal cell activity, DNA is unravelled.
- In preparation for mitosis, the DNA will replicate (S - phase of the cell cycle)
- Then during the interface, DNA condenses, forming chromosomes.
