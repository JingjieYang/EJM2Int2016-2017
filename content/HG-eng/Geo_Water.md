# Water
### Enough? 
yes.

### But:
- Geographically uneven
- Population ↗ =>  Demand ↗
	- life style:
		- agricultural
		- industrialization
		- food habits
- Safe / sanitized water 
	- free of disease ≠ defecate in the wild (1.2 billion)  

#

	unequal distribution <=> environmental situation
	                         climate change



- 1 billion people do not have access to drinking water.  
	- contaminated water source
	- unpurified water -> diseases, i.e. cholera
	- poor sanitation -> kills 5 thousand children daily
	- poor equipment -> limited availability

### Use of water
- **Agriculture**: green -> blue revolution
- Human use, everyday / domestic use
- industry

| Uses in     | Worldwide |  UK  | S. Arabia | France | Bangladesh | US   | Japan |
|-------------|:---------:|:----:|:---------:|:------:|------------|------|-------|
| Agriculture |    70 %   |  3 % |    89 %   |  10 %  |    96 %    | 41 % |  63 % |
| Domestic    |    8 %    | 25 % |    10 %   |  15 %  |     3 %    | 13 % |  19 % |
| Industry    |    22 %   | 75 % |    1 %    |  75 %  |     1 %    | 46 % |  18 % |

=> Depends on weather / climate

### Blue gold
- acquiring water	
	- aqueduct
	- desalinization 
	- aquifers
- change of habit + agriculture 
	- less use of water for car washing 
	- watering for gardens / golf parks
	- blue revolution
	- GMO: less need of water for crops
- conflicts caused by water > food
