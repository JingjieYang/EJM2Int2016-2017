# Demographic transition
A model given by American demographer Warren Thompson

## Stage 1
### High fluctuating
- High birth rate
	- children = economical asset
	- lack education of women
	- religious tradition / practice
- High death rate
	- lack of hygiene / health care => epidemics
	- lack of education
	- famine
	- war 

## Stage 2
### Early Expanding
- Decline in death rate:
	- education
	- improved health care => sanitation
	- improved transportation of food => less famine
	- improved production=> storage => less famine
	- less wars
	- less infant mortality

## Stage 3
### Linked Expanding
- Decline in birth rate:
	- family planning: better birth control
	- decreased infant mortality => less need of children
	- increasing standard of living
	- changing status of women: home -> work
	- increased mechanisation => less need of workers / children

## Stage 4
### Low Fluctuating
- stable population growth
- graying / aging population

## Problems
> As with all models, the demographic transition model has its problems. The model does not provide "guidelines as to how long it takes a country to get from Stage I to III. Western European countries took centuries through; some rapidly developing countries like the Economic Tigers are transforming in mere decades. The model does not predict that all countries will reach Stage III and have stable low birth and death rates.There are factors such as religion that keep some countries' birth rate from dropping.

- duration of transition unspecified
- cultural / religious reasons
	- Catholic inhibition of abortion, China's one child policy, etc.
- does not take into account immigration / emigration

=> provides understanding on a macro level
