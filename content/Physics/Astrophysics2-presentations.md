# Dark Energy
## Information

- 1929 Edwin Hubble observes that the universe expands
- Theory was that gravity would eventually stop the expansion
- 1998 Two teams of astrophysicists observe expansion of universe is accelerating

## What is it?
- Hypothetical form of energy, 'anti-gravity'
- Explains the continuous expansion of the universe
- Density: *very not dense*

## Cosmological Constant
- Created by Albert Einstein in 1917
- Denoted by Greek letter lambda
- simplest form of dark energy
- constant in both space and time
- best explains cosmological model today
- *no one is sure why it works*

## Quintessence
- calculated as a scalar field
- Varies depending on location and time
- different result from cosmological constant
- slower expansion of universe
- suggested that it has the ability to be repulsive or attractive

## Other hypotheses for Dark Energy
- Dark energy comes from observational cosmology
- Some scientists speculate dark energy may not be the best explanation
- Alternative hypotheses have not produced better results than Einstein's General Theory of Relativity
- Quantum theory of matter

## Absolute Lorentz Transformation
- Derived from Special Relativity
- time dilation is directional
- No acceleration in the expansion of universe
- No need for dark energy

## Points to take away
- explains expansion of universe

# Neutron stars
- smallest and densest type of starts that we are aware of
- 2 times heavier than the sun, but 69 570 times smaller
- composed of only neutrons
- more mass a neutron star has, the more gravity it has and the faster it spins

## Creation
red supergiant -> supernova -> neutron star

## Different types of neutron starts
### Pulsars
- rotating starts that create a pulse impression

### Magnetar stars
- magnetic fields are a thousand times stronger than an average neutron star

### Limits
Two limits regarding the mass of neutron stars: Chandrasekhar limit and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit

- Chandrasekhar: if a white dwarf goes over a 1.4 solar masses, it collapses into a neutron star

### History
- 1934: Walter aade and Fritz Zwicky
- First neutron stars were though to be too faint and small to be observed. But in 1967 first pulsar was observed.

# Hertz-sprung Russell Diagram
- used to understand **evolution** of stars
- Each stage will change the temperature and luminosity of the star
- main sequence stars, red giant and supergiant stars, white dwarf stars

## Conclusion
- cool bright starts have very large surface areas
- hot, dim stars have very small surface areas

---

# Quasars
- Region surrounding supermassive black holes
- Brightest concept in the universe
- Fastest particle accelerator in the universe
- Most energetic form of active galactic nucleus
- Extremely distant and ancient

## Brief history
- *1930s* Karl Jansky discovered that the static interference on transatlantic phone lines was coming form the Milky Way
- *1950s* Radio Telescopes begin to be used and radio waves are pared with observations
	- "quasi-stellar radio source", or "quasars", are first observed

# Black holes
## Historical background
**1783** John Michell, **1915** Albert Eistein, **1916** Karl Schwarzschild, **1974** Stephen Hawking
## What is a black hole?
- Region in space where the pulling force of gravity is so strong that no kind of matter - even light- is able to escape
	- strong gravity occurs results from mass being condensed into a compact space
- The event horizon - the boundary around the mouth of the black hole where light loses its ability to escape
- Singularity - dimensionless point where all matter pulled into the black hole is connected

## Types of black holes
- Three characteristic properties
	- the mass of the black hole
	- its spin
	- its electric charge
- Two different masses
	- stellar-mass
	- supermassive 
- Spin
	- some astronomers think that many black holes in the universe do spin
- Electric charge
	- some black holes could be electrically charged but then they neutralize by swallowing material of opposite polarity

## How are black holes created?
- A black hole is born when an object becomes unable to withstand the compressing force of its own gravity
- Stellar-mass black holes
	- form when a very massive star runs out of nuclear fuel
	- supernova explosion
- Supermassive black holes
	- one possibility is that they are stellar-mass black holes

## How do astronomers detect where the black holes are? 
- scientists can see how the strong gravity affects the stars and gas around the black hole pull

## Could you safely orbit around a black hole?
- As you'd approach a black hole, you would feel a stronger and stronger pull
- Not dangerous until you approach the black hole

## Time in a black hole
- Massive objects create distortions in space and time
- Outside observer
	- falling observer approaching the event horizon in slow-motion until they disappeared and appeared frozen in time
- Falling observer
	- would freeze in time as they get too close to the event horizon
	- would see the rest of the universe in fast forward motion

## Do black holes "live forever"?
- Black holes actually evaporate
	- Steven Hawking proved this using the laws of quantum mechanics
- Only evaporate after trillions of years

# Pulsars
## Historical background
4 important discoveries of the 60s:

- Jocelyn Bell Burnell obtained the periodical signal (1.337s), thought it was delivered by the "LGM" (little green man)
- actually pulsar

## Characteristics
- neutron star spinning at a high speed
- powerful magnetic field
- Its electrons in motion at the approximate speed of light will emit synchrotron radiation
- Pulsars are easier to observe via a radio 

## What is a "pul-sar"
It is a **neutron star spinning at a high speed**, which will **periodically emit signal of pulses**. 

## Sum up
Neutron start spinning fast, emitting electro-magnetic radiation

# Red Dwarfs
## What is a red dwarf? 
- A star
- Most common type of star - represents 3/4 of stars in the Milky Way (our galaxy)
- smallest type of hydrogen-burning stars
- None of them can be seen with the naked eye - they are low in temperature (on the surface) and low in brightness

## Proxima Centauri
The closest star to the sun, Proxima Centauri, is a red dwarf.

## Why are they important?
Sun:

- Long lifespan, humans could live for trillions of more ears in the right conditions

vs red dwarfs:

- could be "ideally locked"
- Extreme temperature (harder for life to develop)
- Could be deprived of water
- Energy output is unpredictable, can be very dim to intense brightness that could strip away a planet's atmosphere

# Binary system
- a system of two astronomical bodies that revolve around their common center of gravity
- Primary vs Secondary
- Wide Binaries
- Close Binaries
- Visual Binaries
- Eclipsing Binaries
- Astrometric Binaries

## Binary Stars
- A pair of stars that revolve around their common center of gravity
- Born at same time => Fraternal twins
- Spectroscopy
- 4 out of 5 stars are in binary systems
- Some orbit black holes
- They cause supernovas

## Barycenter
- The barycenter of a system is the common center of gravity
- Its position is dependent of the mass of the bodies
- First example, the two bodies have similar masses and the barycenter is located halfway between the two
- Second example, the mass of the larger body explains why the barycenter is closer to the larger body's centerThis is the case with systems where one body is largely more massive than the other, such as the Earth-Sun system
- Strict definition of Binary system is that the barycenter needs to be outside the bodies

## Roches Lobes and Lagrange point

## Binary Asteroids
- System of two asteroids that revolve around their common center of gravity
- Binary asteroids exist at different mass ratios
- First encountered in 1993: Ida-Dactyl system
- Formed by collisions rests or ejecta
- About 180 small object binary or multiple system
- About 16% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 meters in diameter may be binary systems

## from Mr Rolland
# Birth, life and death of a star
### Nebula to protostar
> Nebula: collection of particles and dusts (mostly hydrogen)

A cloud of gas and dust stars to collapse under its gravitational attraction, 

The first phase, the formation of a protostar, is called **accretion** and lasts around 100 000 years.

As more and more matter is attracted in density and heat within the core increase.

> conservation of angular momentum: radius decreasing => density + temperature increasing

### Nuclear fusion - the key to stellar status
For objects whose mass exceeds 0.08 solar masses, continued accretion and contraction finally result in thermonuclear fusion reactions.

`Gravitational energy -> kinetic energy` `Contraction continues`  
`Density increases` `Temperature rises`  
`Hydrogen fuses into Helium`

Objects whose mass is smaller than this becomes brown dwarves, "failed stars".

### Stars with different masses ...
Low of intermediate mass stars (the Sun, Sirius) become Red Giants (Pollux, Arcturus)

High masses stars become Red Supergiants (Betelgeuse, Antares)

### ... have entirely different endings
Stars like the sun finish as **white dwarves**

Massive stars explode as **supernovae** and end up as **neutron stars** or **black holes**

### Luminosity and apparent brightness
#### Luminosity
- The total energy emitted by the star per second

		L = 4π I r^2
Where *I* is the intensity of the radiation

#### Apparent Brightness
- The power of the star per unit of area at the point of observation

		b = L / 4πd^2

So in fact apparent brightness is just the intensity of the radiation arriving at a certain surface

=> problem: how to calculate *I*? 

#### Continuous, Absorption, Emission
continuous, emission, absorption spectrums
