# Birth, life and death of a star
### Nebula to protostar
> Nebula: collection of particles and dusts (mostly hydrogen)

A cloud of gas and dust stars to collapse under its gravitational attraction, 

The first phase, the formation of a protostar, is called **accretion** and lasts around 100 000 years.

As more and more matter is attracted in density and heat within the core increase.

> conservation of angular momentum: radius decreasing => density + temperature increasing

### Nuclear fusion - the key to stellar status
For objects whose mass exceeds 0.08 solar masses, continued accretion and contraction finally result in thermonuclear fusion reactions.

`Gravitational energy -> kinetic energy` `Contraction continues`  
`Density increases` `Temperature rises`  
`Hydrogen fuses into Helium`

Objects whose mass is smaller than this becomes brown dwarves, "failed stars".

### Stars with different masses ...
Low of intermediate mass stars (the Sun, Sirius) become Red Giants (Pollux, Arcturus)

High masses stars become Red Supergiants (Betelgeuse, Antares)

### ... have entirely different endings
Stars like the sun finish as **white dwarves**

Massive stars explode as **supernovae** and end up as **neutron stars** or **black holes**

### Luminosity and apparent brightness
#### Luminosity
- The total energy emitted by the star per second

		L = 4π I r^2
Where *I* is the intensity of the radiation

#### Apparent Brightness
- The power of the star per unit of area at the point of observation

		b = L / 4πd^2

So in fact apparent brightness is just the intensity of the radiation arriving at a certain surface

=> problem: how to calculate *I*? 

#### Continuous, Absorption, Emission
continuous, emission, absorption spectrums
