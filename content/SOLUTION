Bonjour,

The error is caused by an extra (and unneeded) whitespace trailing after
your document name, namely 'Histoire ' in place of 'Histoire' as it is 
in the index.html .

This can be simply solved by going into the index.html, 
checking if the href link within <a href="foo">link</a> is corresponding 
to the new html file name. 

Best,
