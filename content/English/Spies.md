<h1 style="color:red">Spies</h1>
## Chapter 1
### Group 1 - The narrator
> Is this a first or third person narrative? Does the narrator seem to be a character in the story? What do we find out about the narrator? What kind of voice does he have? Does he speak in the same tense throughout? Is it a voice of certainty? Is he a reliable narrator, one whose viewpoint you feel you can trust? Is he an all-knowing narrator, who stands above the action? Does it vary at all? 

first-person narrative; a character in the story.

narrator => old: childhood bothers him

speaks in present tense and past tense when referring to childhood

uncertain voice; asks many questions.

### Group 2 - Oppositions, contrasts, paradoxes, oxymorons
> The chapter sets up all kinds of conflicting feelings. What are they? How does the writer use contrast, oppositions and oxymorons to create the narrator's disturbing, contradictory feelings? 
> (Note: an oxymoron is the putting together of two seemingly opposite things, for instance the phrase 'bittersweet' is an oxymoron.

- _sweet reek_ (p.3): oxymoron; the smell is symbolic
- _Everything is as it was, I discover when I reach my destination, and everything has changed_ (p.9): contradiction

contradictory feelings as of childhood; hesitant on whether to go back for recollecting childhood memories

=> disturbing, contradictory feelings and uncertainty

### Group 3 - Questions
> The first chapter if full of questions. What are these? Why are there so many? Are there any answers? What kind of effect does all this questioning have on the reader? What questions is the reader left with at the end of this chapter? 

Questions => narrator trying to think of the past: i.e. the smell of _liguster_, his connections to it, his past, etc.  

The multitude of questions illustrates the remoteness of the past, and the curiosity of the narrator.  

Few questions of the many posed are answered, and hints are given: among them the german name of privet, _liguster_, is revealed.  

These questions intrigue the readers in the way that they feel connected to the narrator, since both are curious and trying to find out the answers to these questions. 

The readers are left with equally many question: i.e. what is _liguster_ in english? What language is the word in? What does _liguster_ has to do with his past? Why is Keith's mother mentioned in this manner (_weeping_ p.5)? What are the six words? etc.

### Group 4 - Drawing the reader in
> Is this a good opening chapter for a novel? Does it draw the reader in and, if so, how? How does it go and giving the reader a sense of what kind of novel this is going to be? 

The opening chapter is fragmented => leaves mystery => draws the reader in + provides a good transition to the next chapter

A lot of attention is drawn to the german word _liguster_ => hint of something to do with the major plot

Use of flashback + sensory imagery  
+ analogy: _privet_ of his past to _liguster_


### Group 5 - Themes
> Are there any early indications in the first chapter of the kinds of themes that are going to be raised in the novel? What are they and how are they introduced? 

Major themes: past, childhood, nostalgia, etc. => adult view of childhood  
(mixed feeling towards the past; memory and recollection / **selective memory**)

Significant characters:  
Keith's mother: _laughing_, then suddenly _weeping_ (p 5)  
Keith: six words 

## Chapter 2
### The Narrative Voice: <span style=color:blue>Shifting</span> narrative <span style=color:blue>voice</span> and point of <span style=color:blue>view</span>

_Everything is as it was, I discover when I reach my destination, and everything  has changed._ (Page 9)

contradiction => reflecting upon the past and comparing with present

The narrative voice: 

- Old man first person narrator; uses present tense to tell the story of what he is doing now. (i.e. _I walk slowly back down the street_ p.29)
- Old man first person narrator re-constructing his memories of childhood; uses the third person to refer to his childhood self; shifts between past and present tense. (i.e. _as I watch him now_ p.12; _Stephen's already crossing over the road_ p.13)
- Stephen as a child uses first person and present tense to tell the story of his childhood; includes more dialogue. (i.e. _We're socially colour-coded for ease of reference_ p.15)

Shifts in narrative voice  
=> The reference to his past self using third person shows the **detachment** of the narrator from his childhood: we are even given the impression that he is shameful of his past. 

=> shows the confusion of the narrator

=> At the start of the book, the old man narrator is dominant; then through the transition of referring to his childhood self using the third person, the child Stephen gradually becomes dominant. 

=> dominance of child Stephen as narrator shows the narrator's emersion into his childhood memories. 

=> Mix of perspectives: i.e. _I can hear [...] No wait. I've got that wrong_ p. 31 => recollection of the past

## Revision: Chapters 1 and 2

### **Themes / Ideas:**  

- The past
- Childhood memories
- Perception; how we perceive our world and our past
- Child's view

### Stephen's 'Proustian Moment'
- 'A la recherche du Temps Perdu' - Marcel Proust
- Recalls an elderly narrator recalling his early life. Eats a madeleine dipped in a tea and memories of his childhood flood back.

= an involuntary memory propelled by a familiar sense experience

Old Stephen - Privet hedge

### Structure
- **Chapter 1**:
	- works like a prologue
	- Has clues to the meaning of memories

*"Liguster"* = German for Privet p. 4

- Our sense of plot relies on his holding back from explanation

### Narrative Viewpoint and Shifts
- There are a wide variety of narrative styles and shifts
- These are fitting to the role of memory and imagination

Example: `Third Person`

- Disconnects the narrator from the young Stephen
- Allows a clear sense of retrosepct

> "Stephen Wheatly ... Or just plain Stephen ... on his school reports S.J Wheatly, in the classroom or the playground just plain Wheatly. Strange names. None of them seems quite to fit him as I watch him now." `p. 12`

Example: `First Person`
> "I have private reservations about the spelling, but I keep them to myself, as I do all other small occasional observations I have about his authority" `p.40`

### The Present Tense
- The present tense to narrate his childhood experiences, helping him to inhabit the consciousness of himself as a boy.
- Allows the reader to step into the shoes of Stephen and follow along as he remembers his past.

### An Unreliable Narrator?
- *"Perhaps I'm the only one who still remembers. Or half-remembers. Glimpses of different things flash into my mind ..."* `p. 5`  
- *"No, wait. I've got that wrong"* `p. 31`
- *"Where did the policeman come in the story?"* `p.32`
- *:Or is memory being overwritten by hindsight once more?"* `p. 33`

**Definition**: When the person telling the story does not know all the facts, does not remember all the facts or is concealing some of the facts, either from themselves or the reader, they are known as an unreliable narrator.

**Question**: What is the effect of being an unreliable narrator? Is he an unreliable narrator in both his forms? Can this be linked to any themes in the novel? 

*As an old man:* difficult to get into memories  
*As a young boy:* naive + exaggeration => don't see things as they are

### Writing Activity
**Read from "Keith's father ... UP UNTIL ... non-existent you can't" page 22**

**Directions:** after reading the above paragraph, determine the effect of the idea that the writer is trying to present to the reader. After select four words/phrases from the paragraph that validate this idea. Lastly, write a short paragraph below below where you will put your steps together.  

When you are finished, re-read the description of Stephen's father on pages 26-27 and comment on how the two men are different.

> The writer creates a unsocial, dominant and frightening portrait of Keith's father in this paragraph. His unsocial characteristic can be perceived through his "quick and dry and impatient" words. With the adjective "dry" referring to lack of care of others when he speaks, the three adjectives connected together using "and" reveals his inability of communication with others. The unsocial aspect of Keith's father is also shown as Stephen thinks he is "non-existent". Contrary to many parents who welcome visiting kids, Keith's father ignores Stephen. At the same time, is dominance over Keith and Stephen is revealed with the "imperative overtones" he uses when addressing to his son, Keith. The adjective "imperative" makes one think of orders, and reveals the cold and forcible way Keith's father treats the others. In addition, we can how he is a fearsome character as Stephen becomes "too frightened" when he wants to talk to Keith's father. 

Characteristics of Keith's father:

- authoritative
- violent
- intimidating 

## Chapter 3
### Introductory Activity
- Individually, write a list of most important things that happen in chapter 3.
- When instructed, share with your group.

Privet, dynamics;  
a great sense of inferiority of Stephen to Keith

### Activity
1. Read from page 45, "I look..." until the end of page 47.
2. What is the significance of the photos that Stephen notices? What do we learn about other character from his observations?

photos => Keith's mother is having an unhappy marriage with Keith's father, foreshadows future events  
however, young Stephen does not notice this.

### The photographs `p. 45-47`
- Shows the divide between Keith's parents
- Shows Uncle Peter as a playful character in the middle of the sisters
- Gives small glimpses into the past lives and information on their contrasting characters
- Gives an impression that these photos are spying back at him, echoing the fact that the boys are spying on Mrs Haywood
- Mr Haywood, never actually mentioned in the photos:

	> "Lifeless clipped grey hair and ironic smile" `p. 47`
	
	> "Uncle Peter lounging boyishly between them" `p. 47`

## Chapter 4
### Context
- We know that many of the events that take place in the novel happen during WWII as there are explicit references to it.
- Looking at the chapters we have covered so far, find as many references as you can to WWII

References to WWII:

- "The Duration" `p. 21`
- Obsession with finding a German spy
- Keith's dad's car:   
"... maintained in constant readiness for the end of the war, when there would be petrol again ..." 
-  `p.41`
-  "Stray German incendiary bomb" `p. 30`

### *Hope and Glory*
Read the following extract and mark the language which gives a sense of the boy's adventure. How is this related to WWII. 

`p. 30`, `p.52`

### Discussion Question
Look at your map of the close, compare with the person next to you.

*In what ways is the setting and layout significant to the themes, as well as the plot of Spies?*

The close:

- round (the limit of their world view)
- where they are little boys
- * The fact that the close is removed from the very apparent / disturbing effects of war allows the boy to imagine - they are removed
- * Awakening in Stephen
	- "I realise I'm tired of pretending to believe all the things Keith tells me. I'm sick of being bossed around all the time." `p. 68`	
- naïvety, narrow-mindedness
	- represents his childhood

###  Chapter 4
- Stephen being bullied

Question: What impression of S's father do you get in this chapter? 

S's father:

- caring:  
"On and on he goes, in his mild, careful way" `p. 64`

### Stephen's Dad - A German Spy
`p. 62-63`

- Read "My father wants to know ... to the school" `p. 64`

What is a 'Sheeny' and how is this significant to the novel?  
**sheeny** -> jew

- Read "What I want to know ... I aren't allowed to overhear." `p.64/65`
- "My father is a German spy, too.' `p.68`

What is the irony here?

Keith's response: "dismissive amusement" `p. 68`  
=> reveals Keith's awful character: ignoring Stephen even though he has a legitimate reason

### Uncle Peter
"His very absence was a kind of presence" `p. 25`  
=> paradox (*"Everything is as it was, and everything has changed."*)

So far, Uncle Peter has been an absent character. How was he been presented to the reader so far?

**Consider**:

- what do we learn about him on pages 24, 25, 70, 75, as well as any relevant ideas.
- He was a bomber pilot, a very dangerous job. How might this have appealed to young boys like Stephen?

### Homework
- Write a detailed response to this question + be willing to discuss at the beginning of next lesson
- Re-read chapter 6
