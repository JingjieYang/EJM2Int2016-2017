# An introduction to _The Merchant of Venice_  
### Background information  
- written in 1956, most likely performed before the turn of the century.  

### **A comedy play**
- technically classified as a comedy, and viewed as such at the time
- it has a love plot and multiple marriages
- Also referred to as as a _'problem comedy'_, _'uneasy comedy'_, because of the way in which **Shylock** is treated and presented
- Since the Holocaust, every production has had to deal with the twentieth century Jewish experience.  
### Jewish history
- The Jewish people had settled throughout Europe due to the Diaspora of 135 AD, when they were expelled from their homeland.
- In their newly settled lands, they are often thought of as aliens, they were denied citizenship and confined to limited professions.
- Many operated as money lenders (this practice was called usury). Opposition to usury made Jews very unpopular.
- 1290, all Jews expelled from England; in 1931, Jews expelled from France, Spain, Lithuania and Portugal.

- Dependent on maritime trade, it welcomed all nationalities.
