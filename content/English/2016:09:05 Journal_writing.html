  <p>A diary or journal is a personal record of things that have happened to the writer. It can also record the writer&#8217;s thoughts or feelings&#8221;. <br />
Usually, a journal has the following characteristics:
- private/informal
- written in first person 
- having a date (or day, weather, etc.) as title</p>

<h3 id="tense_time">Tense &amp; Time</h3>

<p>Indicators of time can be found in a journal: &#8220;I <strong>overslept</strong>&#8230;&#8221; indicates the time: morning and &#8220;pretend I&#8217;m <strong>asleep</strong>&#8221;: night; &#8220;I&#8217;m back home <strong>now</strong>&#8221;, &#8220;<strong>then</strong>&#8221; indicate the sequences. </p>

<h3 id="example_and_exercises">Example and exercises</h3>

<p>Read the following diary entry. It is written by Tanya Saunders, a woman who lives in Kenya, East Africa.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday, it was cloudy and rainy all day, the crocodiles starved of any sunlight and barely any warmth&#8230;. Then today we awoke to a totally different morning: Back to the scorching heat and the crocodiles returning in droves to bask on the sand banks, while the Goliath Heron, too hot even to finish washing, just sat down in the river and stayed there (and who could blame it?) I had to take a cold shower at midday, just to fortify myself for the onslaught of the afternoon heat.</p>

<p>Tonight, as might be expected, the thunder and lightning are raging again, huge storm clouds fomented in the heat of the day, now towering overhead&#8230; and the rain continues, and the bugs multiply, and the flowers prepare to launch into their reproductive cycles once again&#8230; the tiny pretty blue <em>commelina</em> flowers are already blooming everywhere you look (including on our nascent lawn) and the <em>sanseviera</em> we transplanted into our garden (both on the balcony and outside) are sending up a proliferation of shoots, the new spikes breaking the surface of the earth like spiky aliens, and reaching up towards the light&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Tales from Kulafumbi: The diary of a Nature Lover</em> blog  </p>

<p>Task: <br />
<strong>Disucss the following questions and record your answers:</strong>  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>What does the writer focus on? Is this like the student&#8217;s diary? Why/why not?  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The writer focuses on the surroundings and the nature. This isn&#8217;t like the student&#8217;s diary, because the student uses a rather informal language and instead describes his school life and his thoughts. This is probably because the passage above is a blog and has a wider readership.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>How does she use words or phrases related to time and sequence to structure her entry?  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She uses time indicators like &#8220;Yesterday&#8221;, &#8220;afternoon&#8221;, &#8220;tonight&#8221;. In this way, the blog is structured in a way that we could understand the change in weather, animals and plants.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>How are tenses used in different sections to show what has happened and is happening?  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Different tenses are used: past tense to describe what has happened (&#8220;<strong>Yesterday</strong>, it <strong>was</strong> cloudy and rainy all day &#8230;&#8221;) and present tense to describe what is happening (&#8220;<strong>Tonight</strong>, as might be expected, the thunder and lightning <strong>are raging</strong> again&#8221;). This allows us the perceive the turn in weather, and how the animals and plants react to that.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>How does she use detailed description of the natural world to develop a vivid picture of the weather, and the flowers and plants in the garden?  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She uses detailed description of the natural world to invoke the senses of the readers. Using sensory imagery and literary techniques such as personification (&#8220;thunder and lightning are <strong>raging</strong> again&#8221;), simile (&#8220;<strong>like</strong> spiky aliens&#8221; to describe the unexpected spikes growing out from the earth), exaggeration (&#8220;just to fortify myself for the <strong>onslaught</strong> of the afternoon heat&#8221;) and polysyndeton (&#8220;<strong>and</strong> the rain continues, <strong>and</strong> the bugs multiply, <strong>and</strong> the flowers &#8230;&#8221; to create a sense of being overwhelmed), she develops a vivid picture of the weather, and the flowers and plants in the garden.  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>From this diary entry, what picture do you get of the writer and her interests?  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We learn that she is passionate about the nature, from the fact that she names the flowers correctly: &#8220;<em>commelina</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>sanseviera</em>&#8221;. This can also been seen from the subtitle of the extract: &#8220;The diary of a <strong>Nature Lover</strong>&#8221;.  </p>
